# Compute Decision Note (VM vs App Service vs Static Website)

For this capstone:

- **Static Website on Storage** was chosen because:
  - Simpler and cheaper for a small front-end-only app.
  - No server management (PaaS-style).
  - Fits the low-cost lab requirements.

**VM** would be chosen if:
- You need full control over OS, custom software, or long-running background tasks.

**App Service** would be chosen if:
- You have a backend API or dynamic server-side code and want managed scaling without VM admin.
